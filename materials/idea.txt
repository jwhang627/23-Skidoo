Theme: Vulnerable Invincible

=====

[Brainstorming]

The game sets in "Tiny World", but what do you mean "Vulnerable
Invincible"?

Set in a small house.

You have an invincible mechanic, and it comes with a heavy price.

You left your wallet in your bedroom upstairs, and you need to do so
within a certain time period.

Invincibility only drains your special points, and cannot retrieve it
back.

Invincibility only drains your loved one's health.

Invincibility only drains your money in the wallet.

Top-down shooter - one hit and you are dead.

Survival horror game - but to get the happy ending, you have to turn
off the invincible mode.

Emotionally vulnerable?

Think of Pathologic games.

Set in one location only?

What does 23 means?

What's the player character's goal?
