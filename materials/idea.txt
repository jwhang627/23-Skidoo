[WGJ 157]
Theme: Vulnerable Invincible

=====

[Brainstorming]

The game sets in "Tiny World", but what do you mean "Vulnerable
Invincible"?

Set in a small house.

You have an invincible mechanic, and it comes with a heavy price.

You left your wallet in your bedroom upstairs, and you need to do so
within a certain time period.

Invincibility only drains your special points, and cannot retrieve it
back.

Invincibility only drains your loved one's health.

Invincibility only drains your money in the wallet.

Top-down shooter - one hit and you are dead.

Survival horror game - but to get the happy ending, you have to turn
off the invincible mode.

Emotionally vulnerable?

Think of Pathologic games.

Set in one location only?

What does 23 means?

What's the player character's goal?

=====

[Mechanic]

Whenever you set the invincibility on, it will take much of your
mental health, and the enemy became much stronger and hard to
fight. When the mental health reached to zero, you lost your
invincibility ability.

Your only weapon is a sledge hammer. And your source of shield is an
AMULET your grandmother gave to you on the following birthday you
trapped yourself in the Place for the first time.

Demon randomly appears, and you fight with them through attack or
defense buttons.

You take no physical damage when you set Invincibility mode on. But it
can drain your mental health depending on duration. You can lessen the
damage through your amulet.

=====

[Ending(s)]
- Assimilationist: You spent all of your mental health through
  invincibility before the time reached 2300, so you became a demon
  and a part of another demension. You join with the demons and start
  a new life with them.
- Made it out alive before 2300 (Almost Human): You still retain your
  invincibility ability, but the creatures from another dimension will
  leave you alone from now on.
- 2300: The clock reached 2300, and the portal to another dimension
  is open. You trapped in the Place forever.
